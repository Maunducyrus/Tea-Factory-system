CHAPTER 1: INRODUCTION.
1.1 Background.
Organizations use the Tea Factory Management System (TFMS) to manage tea production 
facilities by optimizing manufacturing procedures through specialized software. The system unites 
all operational functions within tea production that begin with raw material procurement and 
continue through manufacturing until quality control and inventory control activities and 
distribution processes end. A tea factory management system functions to optimize and streamline 
all production operations for tea facilities. The automated system handles inventory duties 
alongside production schedules and quality inspections and supply network activities which both 
reduce workforce errors and enhance business efficiencies.
A main goal of this system is to deliver real-time data assessment features and reporting systems. 
Organizational management can use the system to analyze data produced during different parts of 
production and turn this data into well-informed choices that guide resource optimization and 
highlight improvement opportunities. The data-based strategy enables businesses to keep their 
products of consistent quality while efficiently fulfilling market requirements.
The tea factory management system makes it possible to enhance communication functions 
between all departments from procurement through production and into sales operations. The 
system makes possible smooth information movement to help departments reach their objectives 
and improve operational coordination.

system implementation project in their central highlands of Kenya location. The Gikanda factory 
functions as a medium-sized production facility that receives tea from about 5,000 smallholder 
farmers within its vicinity. Gikanda conducted its business operations with both manual systems 
and various unconnected software applications before implementing the ERP system. Deficient 
data accuracy together with poor information sharing and inefficient performance became major 
issues after this implementation. Key challenges included:
 The process of leaf delivery tracking from individual farmers caused inconsistent 
payment calculations and made it difficult to track leaf origins.
 Real-time production process monitoring becomes impossible because insufficient 
visibility affects the effective assessment of key parameters like withering time and 
drying temperature alongside oxidation levels. The production method generated 
unpredictable variations between both quality and production output.
 Manually tracking inventory produced errors in stock amounts which caused the business 
to run out of packaging materials while orders became delayed in delivery.
 The manual financial processes created time usage problems and data entry issues that 
prevented immediate correct financial reporting.
The main purpose behind implementing the ERP system was to unite all essential business 
operations under one comprehensive system while achieving precise data and operational flow
